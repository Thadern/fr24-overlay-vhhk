ATC FAQ
-----------------
1. The button turn back to grey color after I click on it.
   The streamer (that's me) is offline.
   
2. Why is there no sound for some channels?
   Reception is poor or station is offline (closed during quiet hours).

3. The sound quality is not very good (for some channels).
   I am aware that there are some background clicking noise. This is due to the data drops from USB to my software and I am trying to fix it. The ATC occasionally rotates the transmitting stations. Therefore, I may get a strong signal for 127.05 but poor signal for 128.2, and on the other days just the opposite. 

4. Pilots' tx are missing.
   The distance to the aircrafts is much longer than the ground station(s).

5. Is there any delay?
   The delay is around 10-15 seconds, which is perfect for FR24 because the aircraft positions are delayed too!
   
6. Why isn't there tower/ground/delivery?
   From my location I cannot receive airfield communications. If you live in Tung Chung / Tuen Mun with clear view to the airport (through a window is OK) and can keep your computer on 24/7, contact me.
   
7. What hardware and sofware are you using?
   Currently 4 x DVB-T USB dongles + custom antenna + custom C++ based software on Windows. Streaming software is Icecast.
